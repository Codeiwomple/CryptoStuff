# CryptoStuff
This program impliments the 128bit varient of the Rijndael Cipher in C++ as per FIP197. Output for each iteration has been checked against FIPS197 example outputs and shown to be working correctly. 
Currently it is only set up to encrypt a single block, but functions for different modes of operation could easily be added.

Not optimised or intened for high performance. Simply a learning exercise to better understand the algo and C++.
